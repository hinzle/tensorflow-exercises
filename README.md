# TensorFlow Exercises

I'm following along a course called "TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery" by Zero-to-Mastery on Udemy. My intention is to get the developer certificate once completed.

Course paused while implementing TensorFlow recommended environment setup using "Docker". Currently, familiarizing myself with Docker.

Docker Success! Pushing from inside Google's TensorFlow container (modified).
